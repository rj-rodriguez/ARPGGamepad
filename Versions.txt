2.0
- Last changes done before uploading to github
- Moved to .Net 5
- Split into ARPGGamepadCore, ARPGGamepadWinForm and ARPGGamepadWPF, to split only specific winforms and UI related code is in there
- Refactored GamepadConfiguration and its components (some changed into records)
- Moved serialization code into Core, creating GamepadConfigurationManager, now saving and loading profiles is independent from UI project
- Small update on Profile json structure
- Dx Overlay not working on WinForm project anymore, some issues with the dlls, will probably remain like this
- Initial WPF version, supports virtual aim overlay, will support selecting a profile, but no editing for initial version
- Split Gamepad implementation and created IGamepadHelper, this should allow support for gamepad support other than XInput
1.3
- Enabled Toggle mode for buttons
1.2.9
- Enabled spring mode
- Internal code improvements
1.2.8
- Switched key press and mouse click in case a normal key is used as shift for a mouse click
1.2.7 Bug Fix
- Fixed bug that would not load the keep pressed setting
- Fixed bug where keep pressed would not work unless in virtual aim mode
- Added profile for Diablo 3. Uses default key bindings and W for Forced Movement.
	- Elective mode highly recommended, to set any aimed skills to right click, left click, 1 & 2 slots.
	- Set A to normal left click, used to pickup items and interact, as the action keys are bound with Shift to attack without moving.
	- Start of Act V and any other special camera position sections are currently unsupported, they need a specific offset to work that's only used there. (around 215 in the Y axis).
- Added v3 profile for Heroes of the Storm, based on the Improved profile.
	- Switches Right Bumper and Right Trigger to be Q and W respectively.
	- Left Analog Click is bound to Shift.
	- Change bindings of talents 1-4 to Shift Q,W,E,R, this allows to aim with the first 4 generic talents.
	- Changed X & Y on the gamepad to be A & D to use auto attack more naturaly with melee chars and to be able to use the trait while moving
	   Dpad Down and Left are still bound to A & D as well, for ranged chars and to aim the trait when needed
	- Changed Right click to Z to activate mount.
1.2.5a Small adjustments
- Window Resize adjustments
1.2.5 Multiple bug fixes and improvements
- Fixed a bug where the added resolution configs wouldn't get saved
- Improved timing for virtual Aim
- Fixed a bug where the Name of the profile wouldn't get updated on the UI
1.2.4 Crash fixed
- Fixed a crash while using the app under specific conditions
1.2.3 HotS profile updated
- UI adjustments
- Added complete button definition to UI Analogs (can set a key to press when moving the analog)
- Updated HotS Profile, fixes SelfCast (Alt+Numpad keys doesn't register as selfcast in game, so I switched to QWERD as main keys)
	- Change Talent selection from Ctrl+1-5 to Ctrl+Q,W,E,R,D (use whichever order you prefer or is easier to you)
	- Change Talents 3,4,5 & 6 to Alt+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+1, Alt+2 respectively
	- Change 3 Desired pins to Numpad8, Alt+Numpad8, Ctrl+Numpad8
1.2.2 Virtual Aim & Profile Improvements
- Improved virtual aim for games like POE where sometimes the skill would attack the previous position of the mouse before the aim position.
- Slight adjust on some UI fields
- Updated Profiles for Heroes of the Storm 
	· Default profile doesn't require any in-game bindings reconfigurations, but needs a mouse to select talents.
	· Improved profile allows talent selection and more bound actions to the gamepad but requires the following in-game rebindings:
		- Create a new profile in-game (can call it Gamepad)
		- Change main skills from Q,W,E,R,D to Numpad1, Numpad2, Numpad3, Numpad4, Numpad5 respectively
		- Change Talents 3,4,5 & 6 to Alt+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+1, Alt+2 respectively
		- Change 3 Desired pins to Numpad8, Alt+Numpad8, Ctrl+Numpad8
		- Change any Pins that use Numpad1-5 to other keys combinations (as these with alt will be used for autocast and with ctrl to talent selection)

1.2.1 Bug Fixes

- Closes dx overlay when ON is unchecked
